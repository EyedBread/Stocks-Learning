Title: Deep Learning for Stock Market Prediction
Date: June 2020
====================

====================
Abstract
====================
- Data collection of sources for 10 years of history
- Predictions created for 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 days in advance
- Various machine learnings used:
      + Decision Tree
      + Bagging
      + Random Forest
      + Adaptive Boosting
      + Gradient Boosting
      + eXtreme Gradient Boosting
      + Artificial Neural Networks
      + Recurrent Neural Networks
      + Long Short-Term Memory
- Ten technical indicators were selected as inputs
- Results shown for each technique on four metrics
- LSTM shows more accurate results with the highest model fitting ability

====================
Introduction
====================
- Another study showed that a bidirectional LSTM was superior

====================
Research Data
====================
- Goal is to make short run predictions for emerging Iranian stock
- Employ data from November 2009 to November 2019 of four stock market groups
- From the opening, close, low high, and prices of the groups
      + 10 technical indicators are calculated
- All 10 indicators are normalized independently
- Makes machine learning less sensitive to the scale of variables
- Number of epochs is increased with increased days used to predict ahead with
- For LSTM ->
      + Number of neurons is 200 -- I believe this is days considered before
      + Activation function is tanh
      + Optimizer is Adam
      + Training Days: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30 -> prediction days, I think


Data split: train/validation/test -> 70%/20%10%
Split the data set randomly by sampling, which is interesting
