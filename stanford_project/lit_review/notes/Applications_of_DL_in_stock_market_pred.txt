Title: Applications of deep learning in stock market prediction: Recent progress
Date: March 5, 2020
====================

====================
Abstract
====================
- Gives latest review on recent works on deep learning for stock markets

====================
Introduction
====================
- In this work:
     1. Summarize the latest progress of applying DL to stock market prediction
     2. Give general workflow for stock market prediction
     3. Pay attention to implementation and reciprocity 
     4. Point out future directions
     5. Open Github made to compile studies

====================
Overview
====================
- Papers can be classified into:
      + Regression problems -> predicting stock price
      + Classification problems -> whether stock goes up or down

====================
Prediction Workflow
====================

Looking at the following parts:
    1. Raw Data
    2. Data Processing
    3. Prediction Model
    4. Model Evaluation

--------------------
Raw Data
--------------------
- Raw data categories often used:
      1. Market Data:
           + All trading activities in stock market
           + open, high, low, close prices, volume, etc
           + Both input features and prediction target
      2. Text Data:
           + Text data contributed by individuals 
                 # social media, news, web searches, etc
           + Hard to collect and process (I know!!!!)
           + Sentiment analysis can be applied on these text data to produce a
             sentiment factor
                 # positive, neutral, negative
                 # Can be further used for analysis
      3. Macroeconomics Data:
           + Reflects economic circumstances of a particular country or region 
      4. Knowledge Graph Data:
           + Relation between companies and markets
           + Graph neural networks
      5. Image Data:
           + Inspired by success of CNNs
      6. Fundamental Data:
           + Accounting data -> reported quarterly
           + Low frequency reporting -> not great for deep learning
      7. Analytics Data:
           + Extracted from reports from investment banks and research firms
           + Valuation information

- Market and text data are, by far, the most used data points
- Text is used second most
      + social media and online news websites
      + Easier use of web crawlers to get the text data
- lag -> number of days used to predict the next stock price, e.g., 30 days of
         data to predict price tomorrow
- horizon -> time to predict the price, e.g. tomorrow, or a week from now
- Most studies have short horizons

--------------------
Data Processing
--------------------
- To align multiple types of data, with different frequencies, data of lower
  frequency should be inserted in a forward way by propagating the last valid
  observation forward to the next valid, to avoid data leakage of the future info
- Wavelet transform has been used to eliminate noise in SP time series
- Can create features from raw data using domain data
- Given the sequence of words, the word2vec model is used for text
- One paper proposes a sentiment Stock2Vec embedding model trained on stock news
  and Harvard IV-4 psychological dictionary
- Dimensionality reduction used to prevent overfitting
      +  Dimensionality reduction on input features has been adopted as a
         preprocessing technique for stock market prediction
      +  PCA is commonly used for this
- Given different input features of varying scales
      + normalization and standardization are used to guarantee that some ML
        models can work and also to help improve training speed and performance
      + Normalization rescales every feature of the input to lie between 0 and 1
      + Feature Standardization means subtracting a measure of location and
        dividing by a measure of scale
            # E.g., subtract mean and divide by standard deviation
      + Data split
            # Either sample using cross-validation
            # Or use rolling window, which is use later times for validation and
              testing

--------------------
Prediction Model
--------------------

--------------------
Model Evaluation
--------------------
- Four types:
      1. Classification metrics:
             + Measure performance on movement prediction
             + accuracy, precision, recall, sensitivity
      2. Regression metrics:
             + MAE, RMAE, MSE, NMSE, RMSE, MAPE

====================
Implementation & Reproducibility
====================

--------------------
Implementation
--------------------
- Deep learning models require a large amount of computation
- GPU has been used to accelerate operations involved

--------------------
Data Availability
--------------------
- Good place to look for data: Yahoo! Finance
- For financial news look at major news sources
      + CNBC, Reuters, Wall Street Journal, Fortune, etc
- Social networking websites
      + Twitter and Sina Weibo
      + Provide web application programming interface (API) for the access of
        their data -> usually preprocessed and anonymous
      + Could filter financial related tweets using companies' names as keywords

====================
Future Directions
====================
- Suggests using multiple data sources for determinations -> what I'm doing!
- **** May be a good paper to use to find other references
