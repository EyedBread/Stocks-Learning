Title: A novel ensemble deep learning model for stock prediction based on stock
       prices and new
Date: September 2020
====================

====================
Abstract
====================
- Method is an ensemble learning method
      + Combines two recurrent neural networks
      + Followed by a fully connected network
- Uses S&P 500 Index as test case

====================
Introduction
====================
- People have short-term memories
      + Thus, picking an appropriate historical window size is important to
        correctly predict stock prices
- ABOVE IS SUPER IMPORTANT FOR YOUR REPORT
- Contributions:
      + sentimental analysis to get sentimental scores from different news
        agencies
      + Use two complementary modern deep learning architectures to obtain
        predictions based on both scores and historical data
      + Utilize a fancy ensemble neural network to fuse the decisions to further
        improve prediction results
- Major steps are as follows:
      + Sentiment analysis to extract useful info from multiple textural data
        sources and a blending ensemble of deep learning model to predict future
        stock movement
      + Two levels in blended ensemble method:
            1. Two recurrent neural networks -> 1 LSTM one GRU
            2. Fully connected neural network
- RNNs, LSTM, and GRU can effectively capture time series events in input data
- Fully connected neural networks used to ensemble several individual prediction
  results to further improve prediction accuracy

Preliminaries
====================

--------------------
Data Source
--------------------
- Data used here from "DP-LSTM: Differential Privacy-inspired LSTM for Stock
  Prediction Using Financial News"
- News data from CNBC.com, Reuters.com, WSJ.com, Fortune.com
      + From ranges December 2017 to June 2018
      + CNBC is a world leader in business news
      + Not a lot of time covered...
- As before, there is cited that most financial information is in the title
      + Furthermore, the contents of the article may add noise
      + Also, it may be hard to accurately summarize the article's contents
- They are using the S&P 500 index for market index data
- Will only use adjusted closing stock price as target value
      + Adjusted stock closing price -> amends a stock's closing price to
        accurately reflect the stock's value after accounting for any
        corporate actions

--------------------
Data Pre-Processing
--------------------
- Uses Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) to get sentiment scores
      + Can be used from vaderSentiment -> a Python package
- Applied to news data
      + Normalized between -1 and 1
      + -1 is extreme negative score
      + +1 is extreme positive score
- During pre-processing, all null data is removed from dataset
- News data and stock data are combined together
- NOTE that weekends are NOT included in the data, since no trading
- Only used 121 trading days with six columns:
      1. Date corresponding to the news and stock data in next 5 columns
      2. The WSJ news compound score
      3. Reuters news compound score
      4. CBNC news compound score
      5. Fortune news compound score
      6. Stock data are adjusted closing prices
- Data split into training, validation, and test
      + 88.89%/5.56%/5.56%
      + 83/9/9 time steps
- They use a window size of 10:
      + Use past 10 days of financial news from multiple sources and stock
        prices to predict the next day's stock price
- Normalize the closing stock prices to be between 0 & 1

====================
Methodology
====================
- Stacking or combining multiple RNNs will provide more accurate predictions
      + Then single LSTM
